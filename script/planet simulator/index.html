    <li>So for who that is the beginner the self,x,y,radius,color,mass is a placeholder for the dev. Basically you do have not defined the variable in the def
        , you need to put the name of the variable and call it out when the def is called.

    <li>
        While "def placeholder" isn't a standard function definition in Python, it's often used to signal a function's existence before its name or details are
         cemented. It's like sketching a character outline in a story, knowing they'll play a role but awaiting their full introduction. It can serve as a 
        temporary name for a function in early planning or discussions, or as a placeholder for unknown arguments within a function, allowing flexibility in 
        the values it can work with. Think of it as a placeholder on a guest list, reserving a spot for a special helper who'll arrive later, ready to perform 
        their designated tasks within the code's grand adventure.</li>

    <!-----def 2----->
    <img src="../../img/def 2.png" alt="Explanatory image for the cheatsheet">
    <li> Forget measuring tape, unleash the mighty len() function in Python! This magical tool is your one-stop shop for figuring out how many treasures
         are hidden in your code. Whether it's counting letters in a dragon's roar or jewels in a pirate's booty (represented by strings and lists, of course),
         len() reveals their number with the snap of a finger. Just call its name, feed it your container of choice, and boom! You get the exact count, ready
         to power your program's magical calculations and adventures. So next time you need to know the size of your digital dragon horde, remember len() - 
         it's the measuring buddy who always has your back (and knows exactly how many scales it hides)! ✨</li>
    <li>-----------------------------------------------append()----------------------------------------</li>
    <li>Picture your Python code as a magical portal to a fantastical land. You're collecting all sorts of wondrous things - glittering gems, 
        cryptic scrolls, maybe even a friendly dragon! append() is your enchanted backpack, always ready to swallow up these treasures and tuck 
        them safely away. Just whisper "backpack.append(new_discovery)" with your new find, and poof! It vanishes into your ever-growing collection, 
        waiting for the moment you need it again. Strings, numbers, even other magical bags (lists) - append() welcomes them all, stretching its 
        infinite folds to accommodate your ever-expanding adventure. So keep exploring, young programmer, and remember, append() is your loyal 
        companion, always ready to expand your digital horizons with every new wonder you encounter! ✨</li>

        Imagine you're exploring a hidden library filled with ancient scrolls, each holding secrets and stories untold. To unlock their wisdom, 
        you utter the incantation "for name in names." This magical loop becomes your enchanted quill, tirelessly gliding across each scroll, 
        revealing its treasures one by one. As the quill dances, it whispers the scroll's title ("Star Map of the Ancients") and unveils its 
        secrets within. Then, it swiftly moves to the next, whispering ("Forgotten Songs of the Wind") and gifting another melody to your soul. 
        So, whenever your Python code holds a trove of data, let "for name in names" be your guide. It's the incantation that unlocks each secret, 
        transforming your code into a captivating adventure through a library of endless knowledge.</li>
